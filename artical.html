            In the northeastern state of Assam, the Akshar Foundation School has pioneered an innovative approach to education and environmental sustainability. Founded by Parmita Sarma and Mazin Mukhtar in 2016, this unique school accepts plastic waste as tuition fees. Students bring in at least 25 plastic items each week, which are then recycled and upcycled.

            This initiative not only helps reduce plastic pollution but also makes quality education accessible to underprivileged children. The school provides a comprehensive curriculum that includes traditional academic subjects and vocational training in areas like carpentry, gardening, and renewable energy. Older students are even paid to teach younger ones, fostering a sense of community and responsibility.
            
            By integrating environmental stewardship with education, Akshar Foundation School is transforming lives and promoting a sustainable future. This model demonstrates how innovative thinking can address both educational and environmental challenges simultaneously.

           <h2>Nalanda</h2>
           
            The recreation of Nalanda University in Bihar stands as a testament to India’s rich educational heritage and its commitment to sustainable development. Spanning an area 300 times the size of a football field, this modern incarnation of the ancient university is a marvel of contemporary architecture and green technology. The campus houses over 300,000 books, providing a vast reservoir of knowledge for its students.

Nalanda University is designed to be self-sufficient, featuring a state-of-the-art wastewater treatment plant and solar power facilities that generate electricity for the entire campus. This commitment to sustainability ensures that the university operates with minimal environmental impact.

Currently, the university hosts 20,000 students from more than 20 countries, fostering a diverse and vibrant academic community. With a capacity to accommodate up to 75,000 students, Nalanda University is poised to become a global hub for higher education.

By blending ancient wisdom with modern innovation, Nalanda University not only honors its historical legacy but also sets a benchmark for future educational institutions worldwide.

<h1>Aeroponics farming</h2>
Aeroponics is a cutting-edge farming technology that revolutionizes how we grow plants by suspending them in the air and misting their roots with nutrient-rich solutions. This method promotes faster growth and significantly reduces water usage compared to traditional soil-based farming.

One of the key advantages of aeroponics is its efficiency. Plants grown using this technology can mature up to 50% faster than those grown in soil, thanks to the direct and constant access to oxygen and nutrients. This accelerated growth cycle allows for more harvests per year, increasing overall productivity.

Moreover, aeroponics uses up to 95% less water than conventional farming methods. The closed-loop system recycles water and nutrients, minimizing waste and making it an ideal solution for regions facing water scarcity. Additionally, the absence of soil eliminates the risk of soil-borne diseases and pests, reducing the need for chemical pesticides and herbicides.

Aeroponics is also highly adaptable, allowing for vertical farming setups that maximize space usage, making it suitable for urban environments. This technology holds great promise for sustainable agriculture, offering a viable solution to meet the growing global demand for food while conserving precious natural resources.

            <h2>Teracota AC </h2>
            The terracotta air conditioner is a remarkable innovation in sustainable cooling technology. Utilizing the natural cooling properties of terracotta, this system operates without electricity, making it an eco-friendly alternative to conventional air conditioners. The design is inspired by traditional methods, such as the Palestinian “jarrah,” a terracotta water container that cools both water and the surrounding air through evaporation.

The terracotta AC works by filling its hollow structure with water. As the water seeps through the porous terracotta walls, it evaporates, absorbing heat from the air and cooling the surrounding environment. This process not only reduces the temperature but also maintains healthy humidity levels, providing a comfortable and natural cooling effect.

One of the key benefits of this system is its low maintenance. Without the need for complex electronics or refrigerants, the terracotta AC is easy to maintain and has a long lifespan. Additionally, it produces no harmful emissions, making it a sustainable choice for reducing carbon footprints.

By combining ancient wisdom with modern design, the terracotta air conditioner offers a sustainable, low-maintenance solution for cooling spaces naturally and efficiently.

<h2>Air purifier</h2>

    Breathe is a groundbreaking natural air purifier that leverages the power of plants to clean indoor air. Utilizing phytoremediation technology, uBreathe enhances the natural air-purifying capabilities of plants, making it as effective as having 20 individual plants in a room. This innovative system incorporates Breathing Roots technology, which optimizes the plant’s root zone to maximize pollutant absorption.

Unlike traditional air purifiers that require frequent filter changes, uBreathe only needs regular watering of the plants. The size of the plant directly correlates with its air-cleaning capacity, making it a scalable solution for various indoor environments. This natural purifier effectively removes pollutants of all sizes, including PM2.5, CO, CO2, NO, and other harmful gases.

By combining technology, design, and nature, uBreathe offers a sustainable and low-maintenance alternative to conventional air purifiers. It not only improves air quality but also adds a touch of greenery to indoor spaces, promoting a healthier and more pleasant living environment
